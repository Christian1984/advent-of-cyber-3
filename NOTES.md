# Day 4 -  Authentication and Fuzzing

## Video Walkthrough

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8-HE95G5Q

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding authentication and where it is used
- Understanding what fuzzing is
- Understanding what Burp Suite is and how we can use it for fuzzing a login form to gain access
- Apply this knowledge to retrieve Santaâ€™s travel itinerary 

## Notes

### Terms and Tools

- AUTHENTICATION is the process of verifying a user's identity
- AUTHORISATION defines what an authenticated user can or cannot access
- FUZZING describes automated means of tempering with the element of a website until it exposes a vulnerability
- Burp Suite is a fuzzing tool set

### Configuration

- Install FoxyProxy Extension
- Configure Proxy with parameters from BurpSuite -> Proxy -> Options
- Navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080 (or whatever the burp suite configuration is) and install the root certificate like so: https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-burp-foxyproxy-easily-switch-between-proxy-settings-0196630/

### The Attack

- Navigate to login form that should be attacked
- Set FoxyProxy to BurpSuite proxy
- Make sure that Proxy->Intercept Is On is checked
- Login with random credentials
- In BurpSuit, right click request, then "Send to Intruder"
- Go to intruder
- Select attack type "Sniper" if username is known, otherwise "Cluster Bomb"
- Setup payload positions
- Go to Payloads
- Load Wordlist(s)
- Start attack
- Responses for wrong passwords will usually have same length, those for correct passwords will result in a response of different length
